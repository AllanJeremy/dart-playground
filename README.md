## Learning dart
After months of researching on what I should use to make my app, exploring C# and Xamarin as my primary code sharing platform, I discovered flutter. Flutter is a tool developed by google that allows for creation of cross platform apps. The tool/framework uses dart as a programming language. The speed of development sold me, backed by the projects already using it despite it being in beta. 

## A journey begins
As such, I have decided to start learning dart. This is my dart playground where I'll explore the various sections of the language. 

### Aim of this repo
I'll be exploring best practices as well as syntax as far as the dart language is concerned. This means this repo will constantly be improving and following industry best practices as we go over time. I'm not just learning the language, I'm also learning how to **properly** use the language
